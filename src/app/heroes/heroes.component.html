<!--
    Because "hero" is define as an interface in component's class, we may access
    it's fields here in template.

    Below, we use "| uppercase" into interpolation. This activates the built-in "UppercasePipe". In Angular, pipes are a good way 
    to format strings, currency amounts, dates, and other display data. Angular ships with several built-in pipes and we can create 
    our own.

<h2>{{hero.name | uppercase}} Details</h2>
<div><span>id: </span>{{hero.id}}</div>
<div>
    <label for="name">Hero name: </label>
    <!--
        With this input, we may change the hero's name. That means data flows from the component class out to the screen, and from the screen 
        back to the class. To automate that data flow, we set up a two-way data binding between the <input> form element and the hero.name property.

        ==> [(ngModel)] is Angular's two-way data binding syntax. Here it binds the hero.name property to the HTML text box so that data can flow in both 
        directions. Data can flow from the hero.name property to the text box and from the text box back to the hero.name.

        Beware : although ngModel is a valid Angular directive, it isn't available by default. We may use it because we added FormsModule to imports in
        "app.module.ts" (ngModel belongs to FormsModule).
    -->
    <input id="name" [(ngModel)]="hero.name" placeholder="name">
</div>
